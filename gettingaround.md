## Sightseeing
The program leaves very little time for sightseeing :grin:, but if you have some time left, there are a lot of things you could do in Hamburg.  

You could always consult the usual “Top X” lists on e.g. [Tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g187331-Activities-oa0-Hamburg.html) to scout for the top sights, but these lists usually lack the option to simply roam the lively districts of the city, like the Schanzen– or Karoviertel, Altona or St. Pauli, which has more to offer than its infamous red light district. 

If you are just looking for a place to have a drink or a bite to eat, you can find a lot of nice places in the Schanzenviertel, Karoviertel, and St. Pauli, which are all easyly reachable from the venue. If you are into **Karaoke**, you should visit the [Thai Oase](https://thai-oase.com/). [Frau Hedi](https://frauhedi.de/) is a barge shipping the river Elbe with (often live) music and drinks. If you want to have dinner near the harbor, the [ÜberQuell](https://ueberquell.com/en/) brewery offers craft beer and pizza.

This does not mean that you should not visit Hamburg’s top sights. The Elbphilharmonie, St. Michaelis, Speicherstadt, Miniatur Wunderland and the Old Elbe Tunnel are all in walkable distance from each other in direct vincinity of the harbour.
