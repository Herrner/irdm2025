# Invenio RDM 2025 Partner Meeting

#### The Invenio RDM 2025 partner meeting and workshop will take place from March 24 to 28, 2025 at Hamburg University.
The event is open to all partners of the [Invenio RDM project](https://inveniosoftware.org/products/rdm/). The goal is to bring together the partners of the project to discuss the current status of the project, the next steps, and to foster collaboration between the partners.

## Topics
The meeting will tackle all topics related to the Invenio RDM project, including but not limited to development and roadmap, deployment and maintenance, dissemination and onboarding as well as governance and responsibilities.  
On the first afternoon, we will be having presentations on what has been achieved (including a slot for presenting Invenio instances, see below) and what is planned for the coming year. The rest of the schedule of the meeting will be determined as an open space event, where the participants will decide on the topics to be discussed. 
Please suggest topics that you want either to discuss in the Open Space sessions or present on the first afernoon in advance, using this spreadsheet:

## Invenio-Instance-Rodeo
As part of the presentations on the first day and as a salute to the OR repository rodeo, we introduce the "Invenio-Instance-Rodeo". It is meant as a platform for partners to present their (preferably live, but also approaching launch) Invenio instances, show how they differ from vanilla instances, and discuss the challenges and solutions encountered. These presentations should be as short as possible (~5 Minutes) and feature at least one screenshot. We will only allow for brief questions, but there will be plenty of time during the workshop to discuss details.  
### If you want to present your instance, please indicate so in the [spreadsheet](https://cloud.uni-hamburg.de/s/8xg6eFYm4QoM7cC).

## Dinner
We will be having dinner toghether on Wednesday, March 26, at around 19:30h. We reserved 30 places at the [Abaton Bistro](http://www.abaton-bistro.de/), just a short walk from the workshop site. It's a-la-carte, everyone pays for himself. If you'd like to join, please write me an email to <kai.woerner@uni-hamburg.de>.

## Location
The meeting will take place at [University Main Building, East Wing](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rcRN1qw7tDs4WBoy8), Edmund-Siemers-Allee 1, 20146 Hamburg, Germany. 
### Arrival by Train
If you are travelling from outside of Hamburg, please alight the train at Hamburg-Dammtor station (not the main station “Hauptbahnhof”). If your train only goes to Hamburg main station (Hauptbahnhof), please take the S-Bahn line 1 (S11, S21, S31) from the underground platform (direction Blankenese, Elbgaustraße or Altona) to Dammtor station. It is just one stop.

From there, you take a maximum 10 minute walk to the main building of the Universität Hamburg (conference location). The main building is located close to the station Hamburg-Dammtor.

### Arrival by Plane
By S-Bahn from the airport

First, take the S-Bahn line S1 directly from the airport terminal to the main station. Then change to either the S11, S21 or S31 train that stops on the other side of the same platform (direction Blankenese, Elbgaustraße or Altona) and alight at the Dammtor station.

From there, you take a maximum 10 minute walk to the main building of the Universität Hamburg (conference location). The main building is located close to the station Hamburg-Dammtor.

### By taxi

There is a taxi queue in front of the airport terminals. The journey by taxi to the university campus takes just 30 minutes.

### By public transport (HVV)
You can plan your journey using the Hamburg public transport website (HVV). 


## Agenda
We will be following U Münster's example and keep the pre-planned agenda to a minimum. We'll be using the [Open Space Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology) format to allow for a more flexible and participant-driven agenda. More info to come.

## Accommodation
Hamburg is a very "walkable" city, so [all hotels in and around the city center](https://www.booking.com/searchresults.de.html?label=gen173nr-1BCAEoggI46AdIM1gEaDuIAQGYAQe4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQGIAgGoAgO4AryL3LYGwAIB0gIkMGVmNTI3MWUtMThjZi00ZDJkLTliZTQtZGVjOGJiZTAwZTky2AIF4AIB&sid=a55c0198137463bab24f154a0206ec9f&aid=304142&ss=Edmund-Siemers-Allee+1%2C+Eimsb%C3%BCttel%2C+Deutschland&efdco=1&lang=de&dest_id=ChIJ0a2BwDyPsUcRQyZnMbVZnvY&dest_type=region&place_id=ChIJ0a2BwDyPsUcRQyZnMbVZnvY&latitude=53.5629908&longitude=9.9884069&ac_position=0&ac_click_type=g&ac_langcode=de&ac_suggestion_list_length=1&search_selected=true&search_pageview_id=63655a1e82881072&checkin=2025-03-23&checkout=2025-03-28&group_adults=1&no_rooms=1&group_children=0&order=distance_from_search&nflt=price%3DEUR-min-150-1%3Bdistance%3D3000) are pretty good options, especially the cheaper hotels by the large companies near the sightseeing hotspots can be good value.

## Getting around
The location of the workshop is at the main campus of the University of Hamburg, and just 5 minutes away from the Dammtor train station. More info on where to get lunch and how to get around Hamburg can be found [here](gettingaround.md).
